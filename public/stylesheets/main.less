/*
	This is Jacks. A library to help you start (responsive) web projects.
	
	This is where you should start your project. The page id is set to approximately a typical 960px grid. And, it's centred. The margin on #page breaks the usual theory, but, it works.
	
	The Jacks presets are assuming that line-height, margin and padding are appropriate based upon the page size. You might find you disagree. Lucky that it cascades, then, right?
