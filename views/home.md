UrbanScraper implements a simple API for accessing [Urban Dictionary][]. [Nick
Charlton][] built this to get definitions through [Alfred][].

_**Note:** This was built because Urban Dictionary doesn't have their own API. To
make it work, this relies on screen scraping. If you don't get a result when you
should, something has probably changed._

## Routes

### Get the Top Definition for a Term

Get the top definition for a specified term. `:term` should be encoded according to
[RFC 3986][].

```
GET /define/:term
```

#### Parameters

* `callback`: A JSONP wrapper function. _(optional)_.

#### Response

```headers
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
   "id": "1401399",
   "term": "zomg",
   "definition": "zOMG is a varient of the all-too-popular acronym \"OMG\"",
   "example": "\"zOMG! you r teh winz!!one!!eleven!\"",
   "author": "ectweak",
   "author_url": "http://www.urbandictionary.com/author.php?author=ectweak",
   "url": "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=zomg&defid=1401399",
   "posted": "2005-08-06T00:00:00+00:00"
}
```

A 404 error will be returned if no definitions can be found (see below).

### Search for Definitions

Return a list of definitions of a term. `:term` should be encoded according to
[RFC 3986][].

```
GET /search/:term
```

#### Parameters

* `callback`: A JSONP wrapper function. _(optional)_.

#### Response

```headers
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
[{
   "id": "1401399",
   "term": "zomg",
   "definition": "zOMG is a varient of the all-too-popular acronym \"OMG\"",
   "example": "\"zOMG! you r teh winz!!one!!eleven!\"",
   "author": "ectweak",
   "author_url": "http://www.urbandictionary.com/author.php?author=ectweak",
   "url": "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=zomg&defid=1401399",
   "posted": "2005-08-06T00:00:00+00:00"
},
{
   "id": "2212015",
   "term": "zomg",
   "definition": "OMG was the ruler of the planet XYRZON until 2451 AD...",
   "example": "ZOMG, i love cupcakes.",
   "author": "WARRIOR MAN",
   "author_url": "http://www.urbandictionary.com/author.php?author=WARRIOR+MAN",
   "url": "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=zomg&defid=2212015",
   "posted": "2007-01-22T00:00:00+00:00"
},
...
]
```

Unlike the top definition, search won't return an error if no reponse is found.
Instead, the result will be an empty JSON array. It will return about 7 results, as
this is where Urban Dictionary starts to page them.

## JSONP

All of the definition methods also support JSONP. This is useful if you're
trying to load these methods over JavaScript on another domain, allowing you
to work around [Cross Origin resource sharing][cross-origin] issues.

You might use it like this:

```
GET /define/:term?callback=functionA
```

### Response

```headers
Status: 200 OK
```

```javascript
functionA({
   "id": "1401399",
   "term": "zomg",
   "definition": "zOMG is a varient of the all-too-popular acronym \"OMG\"",
   "example": "\"zOMG! you r teh winz!!one!!eleven!\"",
   "author": "ectweak",
   "author_url": "http://www.urbandictionary.com/author.php?author=ectweak",
   "url": "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=zomg&defid=1401399",
   "posted": "2005-08-06T00:00:00+00:00"
});
```

## Error Handling

### 404: Not Found

You'll most likely see this if the term you requested wasn't found at all. It'll
look a bit like this:

```headers
Status: 404 Not Found
```

```json
{
    "message": "No definitions could be found for: thvbqgfbhkrvjv."
}
```

If you miss-call a route, this will happen instead:

```headers
Status: 404 Not Found
```

```json
{
    "message": "Route not found. Check your syntax."
}
```
